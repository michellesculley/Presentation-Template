This is some code to produce a sample quarto presentation using NOAA logos/colors. It uses revealjs and produces an html file which *should* be compatible with any operating system. 
When creating quarto documents, I recommend creating all figures and tables in separate R documents and sourcing them as needed with the quarto file - this allows you to use those same figures and tables in multiple documents for efficiency and consistency between reports and presentations.
